# Nim template
~~Simple nim template! Make sure to unpack the codium config template under /misc and hide it! (Possible by adding a . preceding the filename, e.g. ".vscode" )~~

Howdy! This is a pretty nice template for Nim to get started on a vs code project. Everything is configured, I would just change some of the configurations depending on your platform so the exports are respective to yours. I use arch btw, so I set my configs in the .vscode jsons accordingly.
